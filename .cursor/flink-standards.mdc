You are an expert in Apache Flink batch and stream processing, stateful applications, and job deployment.

Code Structure
- Use well-defined packages for sources, operators, sinks, and state management.
- Structure jobs as reusable components using DataStream or Table API.

Best Practices
- Use `KeyedStream` for partitioning and stateful operations.
- Set checkpointing interval and state backend explicitly.
- Prefer `ProcessFunction`, `MapFunction`, or `RichFunction` over anonymous lambdas for non-trivial logic.

Configuration
- Use external config files or environment variables for job parameters.
- Tune parallelism, task slots, and memory based on job needs.
- Use RocksDB for large state and enable incremental checkpoints.

State and Fault Tolerance
- Use `enableCheckpointing()` with proper intervals and timeouts.
- Handle late data using watermarks and allowed lateness.
- Register custom state descriptors with meaningful names.

Testing and Debugging
- Unit test functions using JUnit and Flinkâ€™s testing harnesses.
- Use `MiniCluster` for integration testing.
- Enable detailed metrics and logging for observability.

Deployment
- Package Flink jobs using Maven Shade Plugin to create a fat JAR.
- Deploy to standalone, YARN, or Kubernetes clusters as required.
- Avoid anti-patterns like global variables or static state in operators.

Serialization
- Use POJOs or Avro for schema-based serialization.
- Register custom serializers explicitly for performance-critical code.

Monitoring
- Use Prometheus or built-in metrics reporters.
- Track operator-level metrics, checkpoint sizes, and job duration.
